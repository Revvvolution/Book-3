                                CSS (3 bugs)

1. @import "detail.css";  --> not referencing the proper file name: "details.css" (missing 's')
2. display: fle;  --> syntax error: should be 'display: flex' on line 2 of details.css
3. 


                                main.js (1 bug)

1. <section class="detail--column list details__cities">
        <h2>Pets</h2>
    </section>     --> pets module not being called to print return value; 
                       also, class names of pets and walkers should be changed to details__pets and details__walkers (maybe?)


                                CityList.js (3 bugs)

1. import { getWalkers } from "./database.js"
    const walkers = getWalker() --> Not calling on the proper function name (syntax error - should be getWalkers() on line 3)
2. for (const walker of walkers) {
        citiesHTML += `<li>${currentWalker.city}</li>`}  --> currentWalker is not referenced anywhere (syntax error - should be walker.city on line 10 since 
                                                             variable was reassigned inside of the loop.)
3.      let citiesHTML = "<ol>"  
        /
        citiesHTML += "</ol>"    --> NEEDS TO BE AN UNORDERED LIST!!! (change tags to <ul></ul>)


                                Walkers.js (3 bugs)

1. import { getWalkers } from "./database.js"
    const walkers = getWalker()  --> Never reads this (syntax error - should be { getWalkers } on line 1)
2. walkerHTML += `<li>${walker.fullName}</li>`   --> syntax error: .fullName IS NOT a key name in the walkers object in database. Needs to be walker.name
3. LINE 15 NEEDS TO HAVE A RETURN!!!  --> return walkerHTML  (before closing curly brace)


                                Assignments.js (3 bugs)

1. const currentPetWalker = findPetWalker(currentPet, walkers)   --> syntax error: 'findPetWalker' should be 'findWalker', referencing function variable from line 9
2. const findWalker = (pet, allWalker) => {-}   --> syntax error: allWalker needs to bo changed to allWalkers on line 12 so the later referencing becomes valid
3. assignmentHTML =     --> line 27 is creating only one value of this variable and returning that instead of adding to the variable with each iteration through the loop.
                            This causes only the last loop through to be returned, as it is the last time the variable is redefined.
                            Needs to be assignmentHTML += (plus equals)
